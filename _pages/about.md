I am a second-year master's student from [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Chen](https://jiawei-chen.github.io/) and [Prof. Can Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangcan). 

My research interests focus on Large Language Models, Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval.
